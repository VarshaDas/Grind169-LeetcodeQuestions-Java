LeetCode is a popular platform that offers a wide range of coding challenges to help developers enhance their problem-solving skills.

This repository aims to assist programmers who are preparing for coding interviews or simply seeking to improve their algorithmic problem-solving abilities. By providing Java solutions to various LeetCode questions, it serves as a valuable resource for learning and practicing coding techniques.

## Features
- **Java Solutions:** The repository includes Java implementations for a comprehensive set of LeetCode questions.
- **Categorized Structure:** The solutions are organized into categories based on the topics covered by the questions, such as arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, etc. This categorization allows for easy navigation and reference.
- **Detailed Explanations:** Each solution is accompanied by a detailed explanation of the approach and the reasoning behind it and the time & space complexity. This helps users understand the thought process involved in solving the problem and provides insights into different problem-solving techniques.
- **Test Cases:** Wherever applicable, the solutions are supplemented with test cases to validate their correctness and functionality.
- **Contributions:** Contributions from the open-source community are welcome. Developers can submit their own solutions or suggest improvements to existing solutions by creating pull requests.
