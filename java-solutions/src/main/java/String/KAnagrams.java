/*
 * Given two strings of lowercase alphabets and a value K, your task is to complete the given function which tells if  two strings are K-anagrams of each other or not.
 * 
 * Brute Force Approach:
 * Generate all possible permutations of the first string s1, and then checking each permutation against s2 to see if it can become an anagram by changing at most k characters.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n * n!)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 * 
 * Optimal Approach:
 * Now, to optimize this approach, you can use a HashMap to track character frequencies in both strings s1 and s2. First, check if the lengths of s1 and s2 are equal; if not, they are not K-anagrams.
 * Then, iterate through s1 to populate the hashmap with character frequencies.
 * Now, iterate through s2 and for each character, if it exists in the map and its frequency is greater than 0, decrement its frequency in the map; else, that character is considered as a necessary change.Â 
 * Finally, check if the total necessary changes is less than or equal to k; if yes, they are "k-anagrams".
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(n)
