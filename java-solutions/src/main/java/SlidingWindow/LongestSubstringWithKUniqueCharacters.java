/*
 * Given a string you need to print the size of the longest possible substring that has exactly K unique characters. 
 * If there is no possible substring then print -1.
 * 
 * Brute Force Approach:
 * The brute force approach to find the longest substring with exactly K unique characters involves iterating through every possible substring of the given string and checking if it contains exactly K unique characters.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(nÂ³)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 * 
 * Optimal Approach:
 * To find the length of the longest substring with K unique characters, you will need a HashMap to track the frequency of each element in the substring. 
 * This will allow to determine if a substring contains exactly K unique characters. 
 * You will also have to maintain a max variable to store the length of the longest substring found so far.
 * 
 * 1. Now, to apply sliding window, you need to initially start from the first position and expand the window towards the right. 
 * 2. Each time you find a new character, add it to the Map, and if it is already present, increment its frequency.
 * 3. In each iteration, if the number of unique characters in the current window exceeds K, shrink the window from left. 
 * 4. Decrease the count of the leftmost character in the map. 
 * 5. If the count of this character becomes 0 after decrementing, remove it from the map.
 * 6. After adjusting the window to contain exactly k unique characters, calculate the length of the current window and update max with the maximum length encountered so far. 
 * 7. After iterating through the entire string, you will get the required result in max.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(n)
